# Google Sheets Script Calendar
This script creates a simple monthly calendar in Google Sheets. Just input the year and month!

## How to Run
To use this, paste the code into the script editor in Google Sheets. Currently, you have to edit the Month and Year in the doCalendar() function. Run doCalendar() from the script editor, after editing Month and Year.

## Note
This is a prototype, it works, but has not been tested. Many other features may be added soon. Feel free to suggest functionality. Contact me if you would like to add to my project.

## TODO
### Things I want to add
- Add stylization like cell walls and highlighting dates
- Be able to run with out hardcoding in month and year from the script
### Other Ideas
- Integrate with Google Calendar
- Make an entire year, rather than just one month
- Maybe publish
